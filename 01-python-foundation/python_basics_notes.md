# Python Foundations for QA Automation

This section documents the Python programming fundamentals I practiced as part of my QA automation journey.

---

## âœ… Topics Iâ€™ve Covered So Far
- Variables and Data Types (strings, integers, booleans)
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Exception handling
- Functions
- File I/O

---

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World QA Use Cases
- Loops help iterate through test data or test steps
- Conditionals are the foundation of validation logic
- Exception handling is crucial when tests fail or data is missing
- File handling lets us read test data or write test logs

---

## ðŸ“Œ Exercises I Wrote
- `bmi_calculator_v1.py` â€“ basic version using if/else and f-string output  
- `bmi_calculator_v2.py` â€“ improved version with `.format()`, rounding, and better UX  
- `even_number_checker.py` â€“ checks if user input is even or not using modulus  
- `process_products_exercises.py` â€“ multiple logic exercises to filter and validate product data for a mock e-commerce platform


Each of these helped reinforce Python syntax and structure in a testable way.
